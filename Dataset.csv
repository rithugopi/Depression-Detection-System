The Iranian regime is a political and economic failure at home and a growing threat to the region and the world. It has lost the support of the Iranian people. Instead, the regime rules through brutal suppression of those who back the Zan (women), Zendagi (life), and Azadi (Freedom) movements. Many female students have been poisoned at school.
