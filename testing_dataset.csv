@maria_avdv,11/06/2023, The corrupt nexus in Pakistani politics is a threat to democracy and national development. We need systemic reforms and a zero-tolerance approach to weed out corruption from its roots. 
@maria_avdv,05/05/2023," Khan's intentions are sincere , talks about the Good of public , he's not selfish, always thanks about the best future of Pakistan"
@maria_avdv,05/05/2023, Imran Khan did not run away from the country despite so many difficulties. Even my leader was assassinated several times. 
@maria_avdv,05/05/2023," Some of the important achievements of Imran Khan in his three-year tenure 1-He said to India that he will give a face-to-face reply, the next day he shot down two Indian planes and arrested the pilot and showed courage in front of the world 2-He said that I Drone attack will not be allowed. No drone attack took place during his tenure."
@maria_avdv,05/06/2023," Imran khan?s precious laugh when the journalist asked him about Tareen?s party and he replied ?bs mai unko good luck kehta hu?

???? Murshid?s beautiful laugh Ma Sha Allah."
@maria_avdv,06/06/2023," Nawaz Sharif's leadership pulled Pakistan out of the depths of crises, demonstrating his unwavering dedication to the nation's well-being. #?????_??_????_???? 
@NawazSharifMNS

????????????????"
@maria_avdv,07/06/2023, Russia shells Kherson as volunteers are rescuing people. At least 8 people wounded including this old man. I have no words for this barbarity.
@maria_avdv,08/06/2023," It hurts to see.  I love this land, these steppes so much. Heartbreaking ??"
@maria_avdv,09/06/2023, This won?t kick Russia out of the UN. But maybe someone can explain why terrorist state is still a member of the UN Security Council?

While Russian war bloggers are posting panicking reports about front line in Zaporizhzhia, another Russian military base is destroyed in occupied Luhansk."
@maria_avdv,08/06/2023, So much human suffering that it?s impossible to think of anything else. Thank you to everyone who makes tremendous efforts to save people and animals. And thank you to all the countries who stand with Ukraine in this terrible disaster. Our strength is in humanity and unity.
@maria_avdv,05/06/2023, Critical situation in Oleshky in the occupied part of Kherson region. People don?t have access to drinking water and food. Many are trapped in their houses and are not allowed to evacuate. Russia does nothing to help.
@maria_avdv,05/06/2023," Ukraine and Russia do not ?accuse each other?. Russia mined the dam, explosion was caused by large amount of explosives, Russia wants to stop Ukrainian advance and created environmental disaster. 
"
@maria_avdv,05/06/2023," This is what makes me proud of Ukrainians. Hours after Russia caused catastrophic disaster by blowing up the dam, hundreds of people began to collect aid, volunteering to help people and animals. Many risk their lives as Russia continues shelling the right bank of Dnipro."
@maria_avdv,11/06/2023," Speaking about short-term consequences of Kakhovka dam destruction. Ahead we will see disastrous economic and ecological damage, chemical and bacteriological contamination. I hope Zaporizhzhia NPP has enough safety levels."
@maria_avdv,11/06/2023, What Russia did in Nova Kakhovka can be compared to the use of weapons of mass destruction. This will cause catastrophic long-term effect for thousands of people. Attack on the dam is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention. Deliberate and well planned terrorist attack.
@maria_avdv,11/06/2023, Settlements completely or partially flooded according to the regional authorities. 16 thousand people are in the critical zone.
@maria_avdv,11/06/2023," Kakhovka HPP completely destroyed, engine room blown up from the inside. Water level in reservoir is rapidly decreasing, evacuation of people has begun. Reservoir is expected to subside within next 4 days. Some areas in Kherson already flooded. So sorry for all these people ??"
@maria_avdv,11/06/2023," Armed Forces of Ukraine have launched counter-offensive ops in some areas. Advancing on highlands around Bakhmut, hitting Russian military bases in occupied territories and looking for weak spots in Russian defense."
@soni2023soni,11/06/2023," At night, body of a girl found under the rubble in Dnipro. She has just turned two. Five more children wounded, three are in serious condition.

One more reason for Russia to be proud of its Iskander missiles."
@soni2023soni,11/06/2023," Dnipro, at least 13 wounded including 3 children. More people under the rubble. 

How much more terror will Russia bring?"
@soni2023soni,11/06/2023," As I was going home yesterday, a friend wished me a quiet night. It wasn't quiet. Russia launched a combined attack with 18 drones and 15 cruise missiles. 6th attack in 6 days. Every night in the same time."
@soni2023soni,06/06/2023, Two explosions in Kharkiv before air raid. Must be S-300 ballistic missiles. There is no safe place in Ukraine. And yet Ukraine is not allowed to launch strikes on Iskander and S-300 systems in Russia.
@soni2023soni,06/06/2023," Two children killed this night in Kyiv in Russian attack. Today is International Children's Day, the first day of summer. And another night of Russian terror."
@soni2023soni,06/06/2023," 11-year-old girl, her mother and
 33-year-old woman killed. Eleven people injured, including a child.

Russia attacked with 10 Iskander missiles. With ballistic missiles there?s almost no time to take cover."
@soni2023soni,06/06/2023, This video makes me sick. Russian military talking about denazification of Ukraine in front of kidnapped Ukrainian orphans. Many of them have lost both parents because of Russia.
@soni2023soni,08/06/2023," Up to 2,5 thousand orpahans could have been forcibly deported to Russia. Later Ukrainian children were sent to orphanages where they knit camouflage nets for Russian military. "
@soni2023soni,08/06/2023," I have a wound on my back, the skin is torn off. My sister has a head wound. My mom has meat torn out of her arm and a wound on her leg...
My grandmother Galya, two dogs, and my favorite city of Mariupol died...

Zelensky reading diary of eight-year-old Yehor from Mariupol"
@soni2023soni,09/06/2023," Russia puts Ukrainian CinC Zaluzhny and Gen Syrsky on wanted list.

Reaction:"
@soni2023soni,05/06/2023, Student from my University in Kharkiv Mykyta Shkriabin was detained by Russia's military in March last year and has been held ever since without any legal proceedings. Family has no contact with him. Thousands of other kidnapped civilians are held in Russia as hostages.
@soni2023soni,05/04/2023," Very difficult night for Kyiv. Third attack in 24 hours. 33-year-old woman killed, 13 people injured."
@soni2023soni,06/04/2023," Massive drone attack on Kyiv. High-rise in Holosiivsky district on fire. Fire caused by falling debris in Darnytsky district. Multiple explosions in Podilsky district, residential building on fire. Third night of Russian attacks in a row. Never experienced anything like this."
@soni2023soni,07/04/2023, After sleepless night children go to school to get under ballistic missiles over them. Damned terrorists.
@soni2023soni,08/04/2023, People sheltering in Kyiv metro during missile attack. Every day Russia steals hours and hours from our lives.
@soni2023soni,09/04/2023," Governor Gladkov says the best way to secure Belgorod is to capture Kharkiv. Good joke, but it would be better with General Traffic Controller Lapin in the picture."
@soni2023soni,10/04/2023," Second night attack and sleepless night in a row. More than 40 cruise missiles and drones shot down over Kyiv. Despite this, the morning is good. Many lives saved thanks to incredible air defense."
@soni2023soni,11/06/2023," This night Russia attacked Ukraine with 40 Kh-101 cruise missiles and 35 Shahed drones. Huge numbers that show how weak Russia is, as it has nothing left but to terrorize civilians."
